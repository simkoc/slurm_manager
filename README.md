# SLURM Manager

This crate provides utility to dynamically create and manage slurm jobs to run on a slurm managed cluster.
Further documentation might follow, as for now I think I am the only actual user.
If this assumption is mistaken feel free to give me a ping incentivizing me to write an actual README.
